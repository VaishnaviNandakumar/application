## Code Contribution Application 

* The original project is an image classification pipeline which can be used for any generalized image classification problem, provided that a dataset and the corresponding CSV file is provided.
* This was a group effort and since the repository containing the entire project is a private one, this repository was created only to showcase my contributions towards it.

* My involvment in this project was largely based on data extraction and augmentation. In the Dataset Class folder, there are two files. 
* The first python program, is the primary dataset class and is responsible for reading the image and determining the augmentation factors for it.
* Based on the combination of augmentation that needs to be applied, the functions in augmentation.py are called which inturn implements the following functions.
